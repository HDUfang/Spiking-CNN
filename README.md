## 2- The sourcecode for the 2018 paper:

Tavanaei, Amirhossein, Zachary Kirby, and Anthony S. Maida. "Training Spiking ConvNets by STDP and Gradient Descent." Neural Networks (IJCNN), 2018 International Joint Conference on. IEEE, 2018.

*Note: The codes show the algorithm implementations and do not provide a package to be installed. We also recommend researchers to reimplement the algorithms if they want to use GPU (These projects has been implemented from scratch and has a lot to be improved).*

*Note: We have changed the hyperparameters many times and their values are not the same as the values mentioned in the papers (for the sake of comparisons in my dissertation). Please change the hyperparameters to get the best results.*
